#s-report

Social-report is a beautiful social-feed theme for WordPress that works with [ifttt](http://ifttt.com/) recipes.

##Demo
[http://adem.social](http://adem.social/)

###Installation
We will, of course, build the theme on a website with WordPress installed. I highly recommend you to install WP (and the theme) on another domain or subdomain than your main blog.

1. You should have WordPress installed.

2. Get the [s-report theme](https://github.com/ademilter/s-report) from github and then activate it.

3. Sign up for [ifttt](http://ifttt.com/) if you haven't already.

4. [Choose](https://ifttt.com/p/ademilter) the recipes you want to use (You'll be asked for permission before using the recipes).

###Usage
Now we're all set and let's start filling up the timeline. Make some activities on the platforms you've chosen and wait for the recipes to work.

Each recipe works with different periods. It's usually between 3-8 minutes but you can manually trigger each recipe if you don't want to wait.

###Notes
Don't forget to delete the ‘Hello World’ post after the installation of WordPress.

Posts can only be sent by [ifttt](http://ifttt.com/), you shouldn't manually post anything.
